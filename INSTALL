NAFTAH LANG - INSTALLATION
==============================

Thank you for downloading the Naftah Programming Language. Please follow these instructions to complete your installation.

Prerequisites
-------------
Naftah Programming Language requires Java JDK v17 or above in order to run.

The Programming Language will use whatever JDK it finds on your path, to check that you have an appropriate
version you should run:

	java -version

Alternatively, you can set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point a suitable JDK.


Environment Variables
---------------------

No specific environment variables are required, but you may want to:

Set NAFTAH_HOME to your Naftah installation directory.

Add NAFTAH_HOME/bin to your PATH so you can run the CLI from anywhere.

Installation Instructions

- Windows:

Extract the Naftah archive to your preferred directory.

Optionally, set NAFTAH_HOME to the installation path.

Add %NAFTAH_HOME%\bin to your PATH.

Test the installation by running:

	naftah --version

- Linux / macOS:

Open a terminal and go to the folder containing install-naftah.sh.

Make the installer executable:

	chmod +x install-naftah.sh

Run the installer with sudo to install system-wide:

	sudo ./install-naftah.sh


Checking Your Installation
--------------------------
To test if you have successfully installed the CLI you can run the following command:

	naftah --version

After completing these steps, Naftah is ready to use on your system.

Linux Users: For better Arabic support, it is recommended to use XTerm mode:

	naftah --xterm

Or set the environment variable:

	export NAFTAH_XTERM=true
	naftah

This will launch Naftah in XTerm with improved handling of Arabic text and key bindings.
